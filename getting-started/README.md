# Getting started

{% objectives "Learning objectives" %}
* Understand the overall structure of Bender module and the corresponding configuration  
* Access to data, looping, histogramming and n-tupling 
* Combining particles with creation of compound particles
{% endobjectives %}

We'll start Bender tutorials with few very simple examples 
 -  [(trivial) _DoNothing_ and  _DaVinci_ examples](../twouseless.md)
 -  [(less trivial) _HelloWorld_  examples](../getting-started/firstalgorithms.md)
 -  [access to data, looping, histogramming and n-tupling](../getting-started/firstalgorithms.md)
 -  [combining particles with creation of compound particles](../getting-started/createcompounds.md)
